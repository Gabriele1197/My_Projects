below.\n","\n","Once this preliminary phase was completed, the required functions were implemented:\n","\n","A function that takes a parameter as input, specifically the name of a driver, and returns the total points they have scored at the end of the championship, the number of races they have won, and the number of races in which they finished on the podium (in the top 3 positions);\n","A function that takes no parameters and returns a driver ranking, structured as a key-value dictionary where the keys are strings containing the names of the respective drivers, and the values are
